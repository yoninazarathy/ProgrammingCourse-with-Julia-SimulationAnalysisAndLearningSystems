Rewrite the bootcamp (unit 1) as follows: focus on general principles of programming rather than specific details related to  Julia - only using Julia code snippets as examples, but getting rid of anything also covered in the later units.

Split unit 1 into subsections:
a) Hello World and in-built functions/macros (println,...)
b) Variables and Types: include graphical representation of memory (primitive vs non-primitive types)
c) Logical Statements and If clauses: graphics+flowcharts
d) Loops: graphics+flowcharts of loops 
e) Function definitions
f) Practising: Mini-projects and Practise questions
